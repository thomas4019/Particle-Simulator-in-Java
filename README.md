Particle-Simulator-in-Java
==========================

A particle simulator with 10,000 particles where each particle is attracted to the next one in a chain like fashion.
The first particle is attracted towards your mouse. Clicking the mouse at a spot attracts all particles.

I wrote this in 2009 after I learned about vectors in math and some basic newtonian physics I wanted to put it to action.
